We will try to station someone in the main lobby, but call me 917.575.8363 if you can't get in. If you can sneak in on someone's coat-tails, ask security for Virta - they'll send you to the WeWork lobby on 14. Call me then to get to the 18th floor where we'll take over a conference room. Please try to arrive punctually so we're not ferrying up and down 18 floors for the first hour.</p><p><b>Refreshments:</b><br>I'll order family-style dinner and will try to get both vegetarian and low-carb options. We'll split the tab at the event. WeWork has beer on tap. <i>Contributions of wine or other booze to share encouraged but not required.</i> Please email me if a) you DON'T want in on dinner or b) you have allergies / food requirements.</p><p><b>The Agenda for the Evening:</b><br>7-7:30: Schmoozing, Eating, Drinking<br>7:30-8:00: 2-min (for real) Roundtable Intros<br>8:00-8:30: Featured Schpeel from Fonsi and me<br>8:30-9: Big Question, Wrap Up<br></p><p><b>Blurbs:</b><br>We have been keeping a list of introductory blurbs for participants.
