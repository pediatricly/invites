<p>Howdy $nickNameI,<br><br>As you may know, Belle and I moved to sunny Alameda recently. We love the area and want to share it with our friends (you!). Call it a housewarming where there's no actual house involved. Instead, we'll hit up a few of the island's finer spots through the day.<br><b>$eDate<br>From $eStart until $eStop<br>$location</b><br>(Google Calendar link will appear when you RSVP)<br><p><b>One click to <i>RSVP by $cutoff</i></b><br><ul><li><a href="$rsvpYesI">Yes! I'm in like Flynn.</a></li><li><a href="$rsvpMaybeI">Put me down as a strong maybe.</a></li><li><a href="$rsvpNoI">Regrets, hopefully next time.</a></li></ul>Change your response up to $cutoff just by clicking those links.<br></p><p><i>Stay tuned for more details</i>. We'll have a few activites - likely a <a href="https://alamedaca.gov/recreation/locations/288/washington-park" target="_blank">picnic</a>, a <a href="http://www.rockwallwines.com/" target="_blank">winery</a>, a <a href="https://hangarone.com/" target="_blank">distillery</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iHJ4ci7y-o" target="_blank">after-party</a> - from the afternoon through the evening, a mix of family-friendly and less so. We'll try to help coordinate car pools (maybe even party buses) for those coming partaking in the latter. Come for all or part - we just want to see you! Ping me with any questions or suggestions.<br></p><p>Sundry notes:<ul><li>Stanford has a bye that weekend before the Thurs night ASU game. Cal is home vs UCLA, but no one cares.</li><li>Picnic time will be pet and kid friendly. Winery is kid- but not pet-friendly.</li><li>Carbohydrate-containing offerings will be low but not zero.</li></ul></p>
