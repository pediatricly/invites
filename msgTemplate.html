<p>Howdy $nickNameI,<br>

As you probably know, the big <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/jp-morgan-healthcare-conference-biotech-industry-descends-san-francisco-major-2253376">JP Morgan Healthcare Conference</a> is coming up in just a couple days. I'm not cool enough to be invited, but I am, however, definitely crashing the <a href="https://alumni-gsb.stanford.edu/get/page/events/details?event_id=19630">GSB mixer / after-party</a> this coming Wednesday evening (at ThirstyBear, 5:30-8).<br>
A few of us were thinking it'd be great to get the Symposium crew together for dinner - a $event, if you will - leaving from that official GSB mixer. (Shout out to Julia B for getting the ball rolling on this!)<br>
<b>Hope you can join for dinner on $eDate from $eStart until $eStop.</b> Location $location below - but will be a short walk from ThirstyBear.<br>
I'm trying out a new invite system I just built for the symposium! (Apologies if it looks like crap on your email - still in beta.) Click below to <i>RSVP automatically by $cutoff</i> so we can book a table.<br>
<ul><li><a href="$rsvpYesI">Yes! I'm in like Flynn.</a></li>
<li><a href="$rsvpMaybeI">Put me down as a strong maybe.</a></li>
<li><a href="$rsvpNoI">Regrets, hopefully next time.</a></li></ul>
You can change your response anytime by clicking those links. Yes and Maybes will get links to vote on restaurants.<br>
Hope to see you Wednesday! Either way, hope to see you for the next official Med-Biz symposium, likely in Feb-Mar. And by all means, ping me with questions, suggestions or if my fancy new system is un-usable.<br>
Mike, on behalf of the Med-Biz Symposium Crew</p>
