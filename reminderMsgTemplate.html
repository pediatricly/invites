Please try to arrive punctually. After 7:10, we'll only send someone down to open the door every 15 minutes as it's no fun ferrying up and down 14 floors during the schmoozing.</p><p><b>Refreshments:</b><br>I'll order family-style dinner and will try to get both vegetarian and low-carb options. We'll split the tab at the event. WeWork has beer on tap. <i>Contributions of wine or other booze to share encouraged but not required.</i> Please email me if a) you DON'T want in on dinner or b) you have allergies / food requirements.</p><p><b>The Agenda for the Evening (note some changes)</b>:<br>7-7:45: Schmoozing, Eating, Drinking<br>7:45-7:50: "Desperately Seeking" - Airing of needs. (NB: Roundtable intros are out. Please update <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yayVoJFHw2HPGTALyiCgyyZ1atBtBv9ylNVapwbfZqE/edit?usp=sharing">your intro blub</a> instead.<br>7:50-8:15: <i>Featured Schpeel from some very special guests on health investing!</i><br>8:15-9: Big Question Discussion<br></p><p>Feedback from last time was that we wanted more and better discussion. As such, keynote is shorter and roundtable intros are out. Plus, my magic wand from GSB section 4 returns during big discussion. Wand goes up -> convo resets (to keep us out of rhetorical rabbit holes).</p><p><b>Private Groups:</b><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/medicalsymposium/">Facebook</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8527497?report%2Esuccess=7GcSc9MenMD5-zxa-kN_TToM-x5janvu_HMEw0LwSaLTiMXToFk2hhLiKanEipLCLCi2aHOMY2Q0YQnTDIu0oJnh-x5wKBYTHQ">LinkedIn</a><br>Email me if you're not in yet but would like to be.</p><p>Hope to see you at the Symposium!
