Call me 917.575.8363 if you have any trouble. Please try to arrive punctually. Those who roll up after 7 will have to wait for someone to ride the elevator down.</p><p><b>Refreshments:</b><br>I'll order family-style dinner and will try to get both vegetarian and low-carb options. We'll split the tab after the event.<i>Contributions of wine or other booze to share encouraged but not required.</i> Please email me if a) you DON'T want in on dinner or b) you have allergies / food requirements.</p><p><b>The Agenda for the Evening (note some changes)</b>:<br>7-7:45: Schmoozing, Eating, Drinking<br>7:45-7:50: "Desperately Seeking" - Airing of needs.

As such, keynote is shorter and roundtable intros are out. Plus, my magic wand from GSB section 4 returns during big discussion. Wand goes up -> convo resets (to keep us out of rhetorical rabbit holes).</p><p><b>Private Groups:</b><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/medicalsymposium/">Facebook</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8527497?report%2Esuccess=7GcSc9MenMD5-zxa-kN_TToM-x5janvu_HMEw0LwSaLTiMXToFk2hhLiKanEipLCLCi2aHOMY2Q0YQnTDIu0oJnh-x5wKBYTHQ">LinkedIn</a><br>Email me if you're not in yet but would like to be.</p>
