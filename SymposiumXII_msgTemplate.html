<p>Howdy $nickNameI,<br><br>Just as in 2016, "Medical-Business Symposium XII" will be an  after-party dinner following the GSB JP Morgan after-party mixer. That is, Symposium XII is the After-After-Party.<br>$newI
The GSB event starts at 5:30pm on Wed 11 Jan at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thirsty-bear-organic-brewery-san-francisco">ThirstyBear</a>. Thus, I'll make our dinner reservation for:<br><b>$eStart on $eDate<br>Likely back at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fly-trap-san-francisco">The Fly Trap</a> but stay tuned for confirmation</b><br>(Google Calendar link will appear when you RSVP)<br><p><b>One click to <i>RSVP by $cutoff</i></b><br><ul><li><a href="$rsvpYesI">Yes!

Saying "yes" means I am booking your seat at the table</b>, and saying "maybe" does not guarantee a seat.</p><p>Per usual, please update <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yayVoJFHw2HPGTALyiCgyyZ1atBtBv9ylNVapwbfZqE/edit?usp=sharing">your intro blub</a> for the group. We'll have no "formal" program - just dinner and perhaps a couple seat rotations to keep the networking fresh and the wait staff on their toes.</p><p>Private Groups are at:<br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/medicalsymposium/">Facebook</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8527497?report%2Esuccess=7GcSc9MenMD5-zxa-kN_TToM-x5janvu_HMEw0LwSaLTiMXToFk2hhLiKanEipLCLCi2aHOMY2Q0YQnTDIu0oJnh-x5wKBYTHQ">LinkedIn</a><br>Email me if you're not in yet but would like to be.</p><p>Hope to see you at the Symposium!
