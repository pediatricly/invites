Started on a whim, 7dec15. Realized I could make a system for homebrew invites.
This script does the mail merge. Generates custom email that includes custom
RSVP links
Those links, at least for yes & maybe, should go to a CGI form that allows
specification of +1s, stuff to bring, public response, etc. Could even figure
out how to make a custom Google Cal link, FB event link, etc on form. Includes
map, stats, photos, etc.
Super fancy version shows a list of who's going (based on public response).


7jan16 - In a hackathon, I turned this into a functional product for invites to
Symposium afterparty. Shortcut through a few things, so here are my notes:
    Mail Merge: I commented out the email sending function from this script.
    Used YetAnotherMailMerge in GMail. I also replaced silly urlGen with urllib.

    How it works:
        - Set the csv column headers in global. Doesn't need these to read but
        uses them to write the results back out and organize URLs consistently
        - Set invite detail strings. These only get templated into the invite.
        It would be a nice *NEW FEATURE* to import these to/from rsvp1.py because
        I have to set them there as well.
        - Define other vars that the template.html expects & put them in a dict.
        This is what gets used for string.Template later.
        - Setup the parameters that are passed into the rsvp URLs. These appear
        in the formatted invite and must encode the data rsvp1.py is expecting.
        *NEW FEATURE* might be to define a class or somehow import them so they
        are assured to be consistent even when changing vars / templates.
    Then the code does the rest:
        - Read the contacts csv into a list of dicts
        - Read the template html (strip into a text version. used to read the
        $vars but that was a bad idea)
        - Loop through contacts list & update $vars to customize them. Note that
        only a subset are used. First pass just used nickname & URLs. If you want
        to use say LName (oustide the URL), need to add it to templateDict and
        update it within the loop (eg nickName -> nickNameI)
        - End of the loop, template gets customized. Code is there to send this
        via SMTP directly but ended up saving it to an output csv to use for an
        outside mail merge (GMail's YetAnotherMailMerge seemed to handle the html
        fine).
    Stuff You Need to Setup to Work It:
        - contactsList.csv. I think the dictReader can handle different order
        but best to use what's listed in headers []
        - template.html. Has a bunch of $vars including the key $rsvpURLs
        - rsvp1.py which takes the rsvpURLs, stores data & shows a nice webpage
        - vote1.py is optional for additional data, say conditional on the rsvp.
        It's a second webpage in this sequence.
